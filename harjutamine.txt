GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/ ⓘ) is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[9] GitHub has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 and its headquarters are located in San Francisco.[10]

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[11] As of January 2023, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers and more than 420 million repositories, including at least 28 million public repositories.[12] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023. Over five billion developer contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.[13] 

I will be using github to save all my coding projects, and overall just save all my work from all the lessons so i can always have something to look back to. 

GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[20]

In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[9] with a $750 million valuation.[21]

In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$322 million in 2024) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[22][23] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.[24]
